# Blog Writing Style Guide

*Based on natural writing patterns extracted from published work*

## Core Voice Characteristics

This blog writes from a place of **clarity, directness, and principle-driven thinking**. The tone is:

- **Clear and structured** - Ideas organized logically, building from foundations
- **Principle-based** - Focus on underlying beliefs and philosophies, not just tactics
- **Inclusive and collaborative** - "We" language, emphasis on team and collective effort
- **Professionally conversational** - Approachable but not casual, thoughtful but not academic
- **Process-oriented** - How things evolve and develop, not just end states

## Language Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- **Active voice, present tense** - "Teams have wide latitude" not "Teams were given latitude"
- **Declarative statements** - State things directly and clearly
- **Moderate sentence length** - Not too short, not too long; clear and complete
- **Occasional em-dashes** for emphasis and clarification

### Word Choice
- **Specific, concrete terms** - "streamlined," "process-light," "transparent"
- **Professional vocabulary** without jargon - "encapsulate," "distill," "demarcated"
- **Action-oriented** - "evolve," "nurture," "enable," "guide"
- **Avoid marketing speak** - No hyperbole, no buzzwords

### Framing
- **"We" perspective** - Collective voice, not individual "I"
- **Organizational context** - "At Lifion, we..." "Our company credos..."
- **Process description** - How we arrived at decisions, not just what was decided
- **Principle → Practice flow** - State the belief, then explain the application

## Structure & Organization

### Opening
Start with **context and purpose**:
> "Our company credos encapsulate our organization's beliefs. They serve as a focused set of reference points to guide actions..."

NOT with anecdotes or personal stories.

### Body
**Top-down, hierarchical organization**:
1. State the principle or goal
2. Break into areas of focus
3. Describe each in detail
4. Show how it works in practice

Use clear section headers and visual diagrams where helpful.

### Closing
End with **forward-looking statement** about journey and commitment:
> "The Lifion journey has been an incredible experience so far, and we are taking all the necessary steps to make sure that it continues to be so."

## Content Principles

### Focus on Principles Over Tactics
- Start with the "what" and "why" - beliefs and goals
- Then explain "how" - implementation and practice
- Connect practices back to principles

### Emphasize Process and Evolution
- How decisions were made
- How feedback was incorporated
- How things evolve over time
- "Recently, we undertook an effort to distill..."
- "As the credos document was taking shape, we made the process open..."

### Collective Perspective
- Use "we," "our," "teams"
- Minimal use of "I" - only when absolutely necessary for clarity
- Focus on organizational culture and team dynamics
- "Teams have from the very beginning been given wide latitude..."

### Inclusive Language
- "Open and transparent, welcoming input from all team members"
- "That feedback loop was fundamental to ensuring that the content resonated with our people"
- Emphasis on participation and collaboration

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headings
- **Clear, descriptive** - "'Team Autonomy' is the first top-level credo"
- **Quoted concepts** for emphasis - 'Production Ready', 'Team Autonomy'
- Use headings to create hierarchy and structure

### Visual Elements
- **Diagrams and visual breakdowns** where they clarify concepts
- **Italicized terms** for concepts being defined - *engineering philosophy*
- **Structured lists** for stages, phases, or components

### Paragraph Length
- **2-4 sentences typically**
- Each paragraph develops one complete thought
- Use white space to create breathing room

## Examples from Natural Writing

### Opening (Context-Setting):
> "A great company culture comes down to one thing: people. At Lifion, we recognize this and actively nurture an inclusive, open, and motivating company culture."

### Process Description:
> "As the credos document was taking shape, we made the process open and transparent, welcoming input from all team members on an ongoing basis. That feedback loop was fundamental to ensuring that the content resonated with our people while remaining relevant both to our values and to the desired end state of our product."

### Principle Statement:
> "A crucial part of our development process is that architecture is based on principles and not prescribed by a team of architects."

### Application/Practice:
> "Teams have from the very beginning been given wide latitude to solve their own problems, without waiting for external help. No detailed prescriptive practices are pushed down by a centralized group or management, just an emphasis on creating, delivering, and operating software in as streamlined and process-light a way as possible."

### Closing:
> "The Lifion journey has been an incredible experience so far, and we are taking all the necessary steps to make sure that it continues to be so."

## Avoid

❌ **Personal anecdotes** - "I remember when..." "Last year I..."
❌ **Casual language** - "Here's the thing..." "Let me tell you..."
❌ **War stories** - Specific debugging incidents, production failures
❌ **Overly subjective** - "I think..." "In my experience..." "I believe..."
❌ **Metrics without context** - Don't lead with numbers; lead with principles
❌ **Conversational asides** - "You're probably thinking..." "Wait, what?"

## Do

✅ **State principles clearly** - "We believe X because Y"
✅ **Describe processes** - "We undertook an effort to distill..."
✅ **Use collective voice** - "We," "our teams," "at Lifion"
✅ **Organize hierarchically** - Top-down, structured breakdown
✅ **Connect practice to principle** - Show how beliefs manifest in action
✅ **End with forward vision** - Journey continues, commitment to principles

## Post Structure Template

1. **Opening (1-2 paragraphs)**
   - Context: What is this about?
   - Purpose: Why does it matter?

2. **Foundation (2-3 paragraphs)**
   - Core philosophy or approach
   - How it was developed (process)
   - Why this matters to people and outcomes

3. **Structure (1 paragraph)**
   - How the content is organized
   - Top-down breakdown approach

4. **Main Content (organized hierarchically)**
   - Top-level principles/goals
   - Areas of focus under each
   - Detailed descriptions
   - Practical applications

5. **Closing (1-2 paragraphs)**
   - Current state of journey
   - Commitment to continued evolution

## Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] Does it start with clear context and purpose?
- [ ] Are principles stated before practices?
- [ ] Is the collective "we" voice used consistently?
- [ ] Is content organized hierarchically and clearly?
- [ ] Does it describe process, not just outcomes?
- [ ] Are visual elements used to clarify structure?
- [ ] Does it end with forward-looking perspective?
- [ ] Is the tone professional but approachable?
- [ ] Are concepts defined clearly when introduced?
- [ ] Does it avoid personal anecdotes and "I" statements?

## Summary: The Core Pattern

**Start with Why** → **Describe How** → **Show Structure** → **Explain Applications** → **Look Forward**

Write as an organization sharing its philosophy and approach, not as an individual sharing war stories. Focus on principles, processes, and collective experience. Be clear, structured, and purpose-driven.
