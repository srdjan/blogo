          Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a{" "}
          <strong>NYC-area technologist</strong>{" "}
          with a passion for turning big ideas into resilient, impactful
          products.
        </p>

          Complex tech doesn't need to be a mystery. Whether it's architecting
          {" "}
          <strong>modern solutions</strong>, designing
          <strong>NFT ticketing systems</strong>, or rethinking{" "}
          <strong>decentralized hiring</strong>, I translate chaos into clear
          roadmaps. My background as a recovering startup founder and
          ex-<strong>ThoughtWorks principal</strong>{" "}
          means I speak both the language of engineers and executives.

          My proudest moments? The ones that materialize as{" "}
          <strong>team success</strong>.

          This space is where I unpack the{" "}
          <strong>intersections of tech, culture, and creativity</strong>. I'll
          share lessons from my{" "}
          <strong>20+ years in tech</strong>, but also the stories behind the
          codeâ€”the late-night debugging sessions, the messy collaborations, and
          the occasional typo that sparked a breakthrough.

          My friend, Claude, will help me not loose my train of thought.

          So, let's automate the boring stuff, laugh at the absurdity of legacy
          code, and keep the journey fun. If you're building something{" "}
          <strong>audacious</strong>, stuck in a legacy quagmire, or just
          curious about the human side of tech, stick around.
