        <p>
          Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a{" "}
          <strong>NYC-area technologist</strong>{" "}
          with a passion for turning big ideas into resilient, impactful
          products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Complex tech doesn't need to be a mystery. Whether it's architecting
          {" "}
          <strong>modern solutions</strong>, designing{" "}
          <strong>NFT ticketing systems</strong>, or rethinking{" "}
          <strong>decentralized hiring</strong>, I translate chaos into clear
          roadmaps.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background as a recovering startup founder and ex-<strong>
            ThoughtWorks principal
          </strong>{" "}
          means I speak both the language of engineers and executives.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <p>
            My proudest moments? The ones that materialize as{" "}
            <strong>team success</strong>.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <p>
          This space is where I unpack the{" "}
          <strong>intersections of tech, culture, and creativity</strong>. I'll
          share lessons from my{" "}
          <strong>20+ years in tech</strong>, but also the stories behind the
          code.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll find late-night debugging sessions, messy collaborations, and
          the occasional typo that sparked a breakthrough. And,{" "}
          <em>My friend, Claude, will help me not lose my train of thought.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're building something{" "}
          <strong>audacious</strong>, stuck in a legacy quagmire, or just
          curious about the human side of tech â€” stick around.
