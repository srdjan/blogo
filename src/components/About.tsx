        This is my personal, minimal blog built for experimenting with AI agents 
        and ability to fine tune custom writing styles.

      <p>
        I have extensive experience in leadership roles within various companies in the 
        technology industry. As an SVP of Architecture at First Advantage, currently, I lead 
        Cloud migration efforts and product platform modernization. With previous roles 
        such as Chief Architect at Lifion by ADP and CTO at Cignium Technologies, I have a strong 
        background in software development and agile culture advisory.
