## Yugoslavia's 80s Music Underground

Growing up hearing stories about the vibrant music scene of 1980s Yugoslavia, I always wondered what that energy actually felt like. The tales of underground clubs, defiant punk attitudes, and the raw creativity born from cultural chaos seemed almost mythical. Then came [**C I V I L I**](https://civili.deno.dev). My brother and friends started a band and it all got super close...

[**C I V I L I**](https://civili.deno.dev), a rock band from Zajecar, Yugoslavia, were a part of the underground punk and new wave scene of the 1980s. Those were goldeen years of Yugoslavian rock music. With their music played on popular radio stations (legendary **Studio B**), they've managed to break to the scene that was vibrant, busy, and full of authenticity.
