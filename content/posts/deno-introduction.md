# Introduction to Deno

Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, built with security, simplicity, and developer experience in mind. Created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js, Deno addresses many of the design issues present in Node.js.

## Key Features

### Security First

Unlike Node.js, Deno is secure by default. Scripts cannot access files, networks, or environment variables without explicit permissions. This sandbox approach ensures your applications remain secure:

```typescript
// Run with network access only
deno run --allow-net app.ts

// Run with file read access only
deno run --allow-read app.ts

// Run with specific file access
deno run --allow-read=/tmp app.ts
```
