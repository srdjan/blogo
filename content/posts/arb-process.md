## Lightweight ARB Process From the First Principles

### Principles

1. **Enablement Over Gatekeeping:**\
   ARB acts as a supportive advisor rather than an approval bottleneck,
   empowering teams to confidently make decisions.

2. **Agility Through Asynchronous Reviews:**\
   Reviews are conducted asynchronously (design docs, PRs, ADRs), enabling teams
   to move swiftly before the review.

3. **Address Non-Functional Early:**\
   Proactively addresses security, scalability, compliance, and tech debt
   throughout development, rather than as post-development audits.

4. **Continuous Evolution and history of Decisions:**\
   Architecture is dynamic; ARB supports incremental improvements and continuous
   adjustments. These decisions are captured in Architecture Decision Records
   (ADRs) for future reference.

5. **Collaboration Over Control:**\
   ARB fosters cross-functional collaboration, offering insights from security,
   operations, compliance, and more, while decisions remain with product teams.

6. **Contributing to Product Features:**\
   ARB contributes insights to functional requirements, user experience as well
   as architectural recommendations that directly enhancing product features and
   customer value.

7. **Maximize Reuse and Shared Services:**\
   ARB proactively encourages teams to leverage shared and common business
   services, reducing redundancy and promoting enterprise-wide consistency.

### Actionable Steps for ARB Integration

| Action                                             | Description                                                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Asynchronous Design Reviews**                    | Teams submit standardized design documents asynchronously; ARB provides feedback within a defined timeframe.                             | Reviews with ARB feedback provided asynchronously and via comments.                                                                    |
| **Self-Service Templates and Checklists**          | Equip teams with templates and compliance checklists, enabling autonomous baseline quality verification.                                 | A standardized "ARB" checklist covering security, scalability, logging, and compliance.                                                |
| **Cross-Functional Liaisons**                      | ARB assigns architecture champions or domain experts who proactively engage with product teams.                                          | A Data architect advises a team implementing critical database design choices.                                                         |
| **Continuous Learning & Iteration**                | Maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and tech debt registers to continuously track, revisit, and evolve architecture decisions. | Team revisits its database choice documented in an ADR after scaling issues in production.                                             |
| **Product Feature Alignment & Shared Services**    | ARB proactively discovers andidentifies opportunities for alignment and reuse of common core & business services across teams.           | Central authentication services reused by multiple teams rather than separate implementations.                                         |
| **ARB Contribution to Product Roadmap**            | ARB collaborates with product teams to translate architectural improvements into customer-facing product features.                       | Recommendations for enhanced observability tools for better analytics.                                                                 |
| **AI Chatbot for Historical ADR Insights** _(new)_ | Integrate an AI-powered chatbot to facilitate insights from historical ADRs, enabling quick access to past architecture decisions.       | Developers ask chatbot, "Have we previously decided on Redis vs. Memcached for caching?" and receive immediate context from past ADRs. |
