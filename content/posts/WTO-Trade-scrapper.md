## Executive Summary

The WTO Trade Compliance Monitoring System is a cloud-native, globally distributed platform designed to collect, process, and distribute regulatory trade compliance updates from all 164 WTO member countries in real-time. This comprehensive system provides automated monitoring, intelligent change detection, multi-language support, and comprehensive API integration capabilities.

**Key Objectives:**

- Monitor regulatory changes across 164 WTO member countries
- Process and standardize diverse regulatory data formats
- Provide real-time notifications and updates
- Support multiple languages and legal frameworks
- Enable seamless third-party integrations

## The Challenge

Global trade compliance presents unique challenges in today's interconnected economy. With 164 WTO member countries, each maintaining their own regulatory frameworks, languages, and legal systems, staying current with trade compliance requirements is a monumental task. Traditional approaches to monitoring regulatory changes are manual, time-consuming, and prone to critical oversights that can result in significant compliance violations and financial penalties.

## High-Level System Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers:
