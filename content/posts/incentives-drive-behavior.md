excerpt: Investigating how compensation structures—particularly equity ownership—shape behavior and exploring whether skin in the game might fundamentally change how people make decisions.
---

I've been investigating a question that fascinates me: what happens when employees own a piece of what they're building? As I explored compensation structures across different organizations, I discovered patterns that seem obvious in retrospect but are remarkably powerful in practice.

What struck me is how financial incentives function like architectural constraints in code—they create the environment in which decisions are made. I found answer in examining teams where people had real skin in the game through equity ownership versus those operating purely on salary. The difference in behavior and outcomes was, to me, surprisingly consistent.

This led me to investigate a deeper question: could the ratio of equity-incentivized employees fundamentally determine an organization's capacity for long-term value creation?

## Discovering the Power of Ownership

As I investigated different compensation models, what became clear to me is that organizations exist at the intersection of individual interests and collective goals. The question I kept exploring: could compensation structures either align these forces or create friction between them?

### Examining Equity as Skin in the Game

What I discovered investigating compensation design is it operates like software architecture—creating the environment in which decisions are made. Well-designed systems make desired behaviors the path of least resistance. What interested me most was examining what happens when people have actual ownership.

Three patterns emerged that I found compelling:

**Equity participation creates genuine alignment with long-term value.** As I observed teams where employees held meaningful equity, I noticed their financial outcomes depended on company performance over time. This means when someone owns part of the outcome, they make trade-offs differently—not because they should, but because it's rational. The risk-reward calculus fundamentally changes.

**Salary-only structures optimize for job retention, not value creation.** What I found examining salary-only teams is that without upside participation, financial security depends entirely on employment continuity. This creates risk aversion and discourages behaviors that might threaten stability, even when those behaviors would benefit the organization. To me is interesting how this manifests: people avoid the very innovation and bold moves that could create breakthrough value.

**The ratio matters more than the total.** As I dug deeper, I discovered that having 20% of employees with meaningful equity creates different dynamics than having 80%. The tipping point seems to occur when a critical mass of decision-makers think like owners rather than employees.

### What I've Observed About Misalignment

As I investigated different organizations, I kept discovering the same gap: declared values like innovation, collaboration, and customer focus while compensating for individual output, speed, and revenue regardless of quality or sustainability.

The disconnect manifests predictably. I've observed teams compete rather than collaborate when individual bonuses are at stake. Engineers optimize for easily measured metrics while avoiding important work that doesn't generate trackable outputs. Sales teams prioritize deal closure over customer success when commission structures reward signatures rather than outcomes.

What clicked for me is that closing this gap requires treating incentive design as strategic architecture, not administrative overhead. And equity ownership, I discovered, might be the most powerful alignment mechanism available.

## Examining Common Misalignment Patterns

As I investigated different compensation structures, I discovered certain patterns that predictably work against stated organizational goals. What I found interesting is how consistent these patterns are across different companies.

### Sales Compensation: What Happens Without Skin in the Game

**What I observed**: Commission paid entirely at contract signing, with no connection to customer outcomes or long-term success.

**The behavior that emerges**: I've watched sales teams optimize for deal closure regardless of customer fit. Promises get made that delivery teams cannot fulfill. Features committed to unrealistic timelines. The contract signs, the commission pays, and problems transfer to product and customer success teams.

What strikes me is how different this becomes when salespeople have equity. Suddenly, customer churn matters personally—it affects their ownership value. The long-term relationship becomes more valuable than the short-term commission.

**Organizational consequences**:
- Customer churn increases after initial contract periods
- Product roadmaps become reactive to individual deal commitments
- Customer success teams operate in constant firefighting mode
- Brand reputation suffers from unmet expectations

**What I've found works better**: Combine equity ownership with deferred commission tied to customer outcomes.

As I investigated aligned structures, I discovered that when sales teams hold meaningful equity AND have commission tied to retention milestones, behavior transforms. They qualify prospects more rigorously, set realistic expectations, and collaborate with delivery teams—not because they're told to, but because their ownership stake makes customer success personally valuable.

This means the equity creates long-term alignment while deferred commission creates immediate feedback loops. The combination is, to me, more powerful than either alone.

**What changes with ownership**:
- Churn rates matter to individual wealth
- Customer relationships become personal assets
- Product commitments stay realistic
- Collaboration emerges naturally from shared ownership

### Engineering Compensation: How Equity Changes Technical Decisions

**What I observed**: Individual bonuses based on story points completed, lines of code written, or features shipped.

**The behavior that emerges**: I've watched engineers game metrics predictably. Estimates inflate on simple tasks. Complex infrastructure work gets avoided. Technical debt accumulates. Lines of code become goals rather than byproducts. Quality suffers as individuals optimize for point accumulation over sustainable engineering.

**What I discovered about equity ownership**: When engineers hold meaningful equity, I noticed something fascinating—they start caring about technical debt because it affects the company's long-term value and thus their personal wealth. The calculus shifts from "will this get me points this sprint?" to "will this make the company more valuable?"

To me is interesting how this manifests. Engineers with ownership voluntarily tackle technical debt, refactor critical systems, and invest in infrastructure—not because managers tell them to, but because they understand how these investments compound into company value over time.

**What changes with skin in the game**:
- Technical debt reduction becomes personally valuable
- System reliability directly affects personal wealth
- Long-term architectural decisions make rational sense
- Quality emerges from ownership, not process
- Collaboration serves shared financial interest

This means combining team-based goals with equity ownership creates environments where sustainable engineering isn't a sacrifice—it's a rational investment in personal wealth.

### Customer Support Compensation: Throughput Over Resolution

**The misalignment**: Bonuses tied to maximum tickets handled per day or average call duration.

**The resulting behavior**: Support becomes a ticket-closing factory. Representatives rush through interactions, provide generic responses, and optimize for speed. Root causes go unaddressed, leading to repeat contacts. Customer satisfaction declines while ticket counts rise.

**Organizational consequences**:
- Customer satisfaction scores decline
- Repeat contact rates increase
- Support staff experience frustration
- Support becomes a churn driver rather than retention mechanism

**The aligned approach**: Compensation tied to customer satisfaction and first-contact resolution.

Weight bonuses toward customer satisfaction scores and first-contact resolution rates. Remove speed-based metrics that create perverse incentives.

Representatives begin taking the time necessary to solve problems thoroughly. They investigate root causes and escalate systemic issues. Support transforms from a cost center to minimize into a source of valuable product insights.

**Results from aligned incentives**:
- Customer satisfaction improves
- Repeat contacts decrease
- Product feedback becomes more valuable
- Support becomes a strategic capability

## Discovering Principles for Ownership-Based Incentives

As I investigated effective incentive systems, I discovered patterns that might fundamentally change how we think about compensation. What I found most compelling is the central role of equity ownership.

### The Critical Role of Equity Ratios

What I've come to believe is that the percentage of employees with meaningful equity might be the single most important factor in organizational performance. As I examined different companies, I noticed clear patterns:

**Below 20% equity participation**: Innovation happens when management demands it. Technical debt accumulates. Short-term thinking dominates. People optimize for job security.

**20-50% equity participation**: Mixed behaviors emerge. Some teams think long-term, others optimize for bonuses. Cultural inconsistency creates friction.

**Above 50% equity participation**: Something shifts. I observed people naturally making decisions that benefit long-term value. Technical excellence emerges without mandates. Collaboration serves rational self-interest.

To me is interesting how this tipping point works. When a majority holds ownership, the culture itself shifts from employee to owner mindset. Decisions that seemed like sacrifices—investing in infrastructure, addressing technical debt, prioritizing customer success—become obviously rational.

### Examining Outcomes Versus Activity

What I discovered investigating metrics:

**Activity metrics** measure motion:
- Lines of code written
- Features shipped
- Tickets closed
- Hours worked

**Outcome metrics** measure value:
- Company valuation (which equity holders care about personally)
- Customer retention rates
- System reliability
- Revenue growth per employee

When people own equity, outcome metrics become personally relevant. This means you don't need to force optimization—it happens naturally because it serves individual wealth creation.

### Emphasize Team Success Over Individual Performance

Individual incentives create internal competition. Team-based rewards foster collaboration.

**Effective team structures**:

**Squad-level bonuses**: Cross-functional teams share rewards based on their product or service metrics. When the whole team succeeds or fails together, collaboration becomes rational rather than altruistic.

**Department-level goals**: Functional teams are rewarded for capability development and knowledge sharing, not just individual output.

**Company-wide participation**: Broad-based equity plans or profit sharing ensure everyone benefits from overall organizational success.

**Peer recognition systems**: Non-monetary recognition for collaborative behavior reinforces cultural values.

These structures make helping teammates serve individual interests.

### Balance Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives

Quarterly metrics drive quarterly behavior. Sustainable success requires long-term thinking.

**Balanced timeframe approach**:

**Immediate** (quarterly): 30% weight on sprint or quarterly goals provides near-term motivation and feedback.

**Medium-term** (annual): 40% weight on year-long initiatives and capability building encourages investment in sustainable practices.

**Long-term** (multi-year): 30% weight on strategic goals and long-term value creation prevents sacrificing future health for current performance.

This prevents organizations from burning future capacity to meet present deadlines.

### Maintain Transparency and Simplicity

Complex incentive systems breed confusion and cynicism. People need clear understanding of how actions connect to rewards.

**Transparency requirements**:

**Clear metrics**: Everyone understands what is measured and why.

**Visible progress**: Real-time dashboards show team performance against goals.

**Direct connection**: Obvious links between individual work and team outcomes.

**Fair assessment**: Consistent evaluation criteria across teams.

**Regular communication**: Frequent updates on performance and payout status.

When people understand the system, they optimize appropriately rather than gaming opaque metrics.

## Implementation Approach

Moving from misaligned to aligned incentive structures requires systematic change.

### Audit Current Incentive Structures

**Questions for assessment**:

1. What behaviors do current incentives actually reward?
2. What gaps exist between stated values and compensation structures?
3. Where do individual and organizational goals conflict?
4. What gaming behaviors have emerged around current metrics?
5. Which cross-team frictions result from misaligned incentives?

Honest assessment reveals the distance between intention and reality.

### Redesign Systematically

**Process steps**:

**Start with desired behaviors**: List specific behaviors that support organizational goals.

**Work backward to metrics**: Identify measurable indicators of those behaviors.

**Design reward structures**: Create compensation tied to identified metrics.

**Test with pilot teams**: Run new systems with limited groups first.

**Gather feedback**: Learn what works and what creates unintended consequences.

**Iterate and expand**: Refine based on learnings before full rollout.

This approach minimizes risk while enabling learning.

### Address Transition Challenges

**Common concerns and responses**:

**"Team metrics punish high performers"**: Include individual growth opportunities and peer recognition alongside team incentives.

**"Outcome metrics are harder to measure"**: Invest in proper instrumentation and analytics capabilities.

**"Our compensation approach is industry standard"**: Be willing to differentiate on what matters to organizational success.

**"Long-term incentives don't motivate immediately"**: Combine timeframes for balanced motivation.

Change management requires addressing concerns directly and building conviction in the new approach.

## Measuring Effectiveness

Track both leading and lagging indicators of incentive system health.

**Leading indicators** (early signals):
- Cross-team collaboration frequency
- Knowledge sharing activity
- Proactive problem identification
- Quality improvement initiatives
- Customer-focused discussions

**Lagging indicators** (outcome measures):
- Employee retention rates
- Customer satisfaction trends
- Revenue per employee
- Technical debt levels
- Time to market for capabilities

Effective incentive systems improve both categories over time.

## Common Implementation Pitfalls

Several patterns consistently undermine incentive system effectiveness.

### Over-Indexing on Measurability

Not everything important is easily measured. Ignoring crucial behaviors because they are hard to quantify creates blind spots.

Balance quantitative metrics (70% weight) with qualitative assessments (30% weight) including peer feedback, manager observation, and customer testimonials.

### Creating Too Many Metrics

Complexity dilutes focus. More than 3-5 key metrics per role creates confusion rather than clarity.

Each person should clearly answer: "What are my top 3 success metrics this quarter?"

### Ignoring Unintended Consequences

Every incentive creates optimization behavior. Some will be unwanted.

Conduct regular retrospectives on incentive system health and maintain willingness to adjust quickly when problems emerge.

### Treating Incentives as Static

Business context evolves. Incentive systems must evolve accordingly.

Review incentive alignment with strategic goals quarterly, not annually.

## Questions Worth Exploring

As I continue investigating incentive structures, I'm curious about several possibilities:

- Could the ratio of equity-holding employees predict organizational performance more accurately than traditional metrics?
- Might there be an optimal equity distribution curve that maximizes alignment while maintaining motivation?
- Would different industries require different equity ratio thresholds to achieve owner mindset?
- How might equity vesting schedules affect the transition from employee to owner behavior?
- Could transparent equity ownership data change how teams collaborate and make decisions?

### What I've Come to Appreciate About Ownership

What I discovered through this investigation is that financial incentives aren't peripheral to culture—they might be foundational. Compensation structures create the environment in which daily decisions are made. What struck me most is how equity ownership aligns individual interests with organizational goals in ways that no amount of process or culture-building can match.

As I examined organizations, what became clear is that you cannot declare your way to long-term thinking. You cannot mandate collaboration or innovation. But you can create ownership structures that make these behaviors rational rather than altruistic.

What I've observed is that when a critical mass of employees hold meaningful equity—when they have genuine skin in the game—several things happen naturally:

**Technical debt becomes personally expensive**, so people address it voluntarily

**Customer success directly affects personal wealth**, so relationships matter beyond quarterly targets

**System reliability impacts individual net worth**, so quality emerges from rational self-interest

**Company valuation is shared wealth**, so collaboration serves individual financial goals

To me is interesting how this transforms the role of leadership. Instead of constantly pushing for desired behaviors, leaders in ownership cultures create environments where those behaviors serve individual wealth creation. The energy shifts from enforcement to enablement.

### The Compounding Effect of Ownership

What I find most compelling about equity-based incentives is how they compound over time. Each good decision increases company value, which increases personal wealth, which reinforces the decision-making pattern. The system becomes self-reinforcing in ways that salary and bonuses never achieve.

The space for exploring ownership-based organizational design remains largely open, and I find it exciting that there's significant potential for continued investigation into how equity ratios shape not just individual behavior but entire organizational cultures.

What remains to be discovered: could optimizing for equity participation ratios unlock levels of organizational performance that traditional compensation structures simply cannot reach?
