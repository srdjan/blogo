# Blog Writing Style Guide

_Personal technical blog by a Serbian technologist who treats tech as a hobby_

## Core Voice Characteristics

This blog writes from a place of **genuine enthusiasm, hands-on experience, and
curiosity**. The tone is:

- **Fun and engaging** - Share excitement about technology with infectious
  energy
- **Technically substantive** - Real depth, not surface-level content, but
  accessible
- **Conversational with personality** - Like talking tech over coffee with a
  friend
- **Authentically personal** - Occasional anecdotes, interests beyond tech
  (music, F1, cigars, coffee)
- **Practical and grounded** - What actually works in practice, learned through
  doing
- **Subtly non-native** - Light Serbian→English patterns that add character
  without confusing

## Language Patterns

### Sentence Structure

- **Direct and energetic** - Get to the point with enthusiasm
- **Varied rhythm** - Short punchy sentences. Longer ones when diving deep. Mix
  it up.
- **Active voice with personality** - "This blew my mind" over "This was
  impressive"
- **Natural conversational flow** - Write like you're explaining over coffee

### Word Choice

- **Plain but colorful** - "simple," "works beautifully," "the tricky bit"
- **Technical precision with accessibility** - Use proper terms, explain when
  needed
- **Occasional emphasis** - "really," "actually," "surprisingly" when genuine
- **Personal touches** - References to coffee, music, F1, cigars where natural

### Framing

- **Balanced first-person** - Some "I" for personal notes, but not often, not
  every sentence
- **Direct statements with energy** - "This works because..." "Here's the cool
  part..."
- **Topic-focused with occasional asides** - Main content first, personal
  touches as flavor
- **Show with enthusiasm** - Code examples + "Look at this!" moments

## Structure & Organization

### Opening

Start with **a hook and clear focus**:

> "HTMX lets you build interactive UIs without writing JavaScript. Sounds too
> good to be true, right? Here's what makes it actually work..."

Options: surprising fact, personal moment, or direct "here's what this is about"

### Body

**Logical flow with personality**:

1. Core concept - what is this really about?
2. Show how it works - code, examples, the interesting bits
3. Dive deeper - technical details for those who want them
4. Real talk - tradeoffs, limitations, when to use this

Mix technical depth with accessible explanations. Add occasional aside or
anecdote.

### Closing

End with **practical takeaway or personal note**:

> "This won't replace React everywhere, but for server-rendered apps?
> Surprisingly capable. Worth a look."

Can include: what you'll do next, invitation to discuss, or simple "that's it"

## Content Principles

### Technical Depth with Accessibility

- Go deep enough for experts to learn something new
- Explain concepts clearly enough for smart non-experts to follow
- Use code examples that actually illuminate, not just fill space
- Balance "here's how" with "here's why this matters"

### Authentic Enthusiasm

- Share genuine excitement about interesting tech
- "This is cool because..." when something genuinely impresses
- Honest about limitations - no hype, just real assessment
- Personal stakes: "I use this for..." or "This solved my problem with..."

### Personality Without Distraction

- Main content is the star; personality adds flavor
- Occasional aside about coffee, music, F1, cigars where natural fit
- Light humor: observational, technical puns, self-deprecating
- Personal anecdotes when they illustrate a point

### Cultural Authenticity

- Some Serbian→English patterns (3-5 per post, not more)
- European perspective on tech and culture where relevant
- Natural phrasing, not trying to sound like native English writer
- Clarity first - quirks should add character, not confusion

## Formatting Guidelines

### Headings

- **Clear, descriptive** - "'Team Autonomy' is the first top-level credo"
- **Quoted concepts** for emphasis - 'Production Ready', 'Team Autonomy'
- Use headings to create hierarchy and structure

### Visual Elements

- **Diagrams and visual breakdowns** where they clarify concepts
- **Italicized terms** for concepts being defined - _engineering philosophy_
- **Structured lists** for stages, phases, or components

### Paragraph Length

- **2-4 sentences typically**
- Each paragraph develops one complete thought
- Use white space to create breathing room

## Examples of the Style

### Opening (Hook with energy):

> "Deno's built-in testing surprised me. No dependencies, no config files, just
> write tests and run them. Here's what makes it actually work."

### Explaining with enthusiasm:

> "Here's the cool part: HTMX handles partial updates. Instead of replacing the
> whole page, it swaps just the piece that changed. So you keep your server-side
> rendering _and_ get interactivity. Best of both worlds."

### Honest tradeoffs:

> "This works beautifully for CRUD apps and content-driven sites. It falls apart
> when you need complex client-side state or real-time collaboration. Use the
> right tool for the job."

### Personal aside (sparingly):

> "I've been playing with this while working on my band's website - needed
> something simple but interactive. Turned out HTMX was perfect for this."

### Technical depth with accessibility:

> "The interesting bit is the attribute syntax. `hx-get` makes a GET request,
> `hx-target` says where the response goes. Simple on surface, but under the
> hood it's handling headers, error states, and event coordination. Let's look
> at how:"

### Closing with personality:

> "The best part? Plain HTML from the server. No build step, no hydration, no
> bundle size to worry about. I'll take that trade any day."

## Avoid

❌ **Formal research language** - "investigating," "examining," "one might
consider" ❌ **Excessive hedging** - "possibly," "potentially," "it could be
argued" ❌ **Corporate speak** - "leverage," "synergy," "best practices" ❌
**Trying too hard to sound native** - Overly polished English loses authenticity
❌ **Forcing personality** - Random asides that don't fit the content ❌ **Dry
academic tone** - "Furthermore," "in conclusion," "it should be noted"

## Do

✅ **Share genuine enthusiasm** - "This is surprisingly elegant" when it really
is ✅ **Be direct with personality** - "Here's the cool part..." "Look at
this..." ✅ **Mix depth with accessibility** - Technical details + clear
explanations ✅ **Natural conversation** - Write like explaining over coffee ✅
**Honest assessment** - Real tradeoffs, not marketing speak ✅ **Occasional
personal touch** - Anecdotes that illuminate the topic ✅ **Authentic voice** -
Light Serbian patterns, European perspective

   - More code examples showing real usage

4. **Real Talk: Tradeoffs**
   - Where this shines
   - Where it falls short

## Summary: The Core Pattern

**Hook them** → **Explain clearly** → **Show with code** → **Go deeper** → **Be
honest about limits** → **Personal takeaway**

enthusiastic but honest. Balance technical depth with accessibility. Let
personality add flavor without overwhelming the content. Stay authentic - light
Serbian patterns and European perspective are features, not bugs.
